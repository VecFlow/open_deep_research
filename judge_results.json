It is comprehensive in addressing the broader litigation context but less so on the specific legal question. Response B, while more concise, directly addresses the expert witness requirements, providing a clear framework for selecting and utilizing experts in a patent infringement case. It is more focused on the specific legal question, making it more practical and actionable for an attorney preparing for litigation.",
      "summary": "Response B is the winner because it directly addresses the expert witness requirements for a patent infringement dispute in the pharmaceutical industry, providing a clear and structured approach to selecting and preparing expert witnesses. It offers practical advice and strategies that are immediately useful for litigation planning. Response A, while thorough in discussing the broader litigation context, does not focus as specifically on the expert witness requirements, making it less practical for the specific legal question posed."
