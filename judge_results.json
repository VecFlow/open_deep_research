      "justification": "Response A provides a detailed analysis of the legal implications and strategic considerations but lacks focus on the specific task of drafting questions. It is comprehensive in discussing the broader legal context but less so in addressing the specific legal question. Response B, on the other hand, directly addresses the task by proposing specific questions and provides a clear strategic approach for using these questions in discovery. It is more focused and actionable for a practicing attorney.",

It is more focused on the specific legal scenario and offers practical guidance for litigation planning. Response A, while thorough in its legal analysis, is less focused on the specific task and provides less actionable advice for immediate legal strategy."
