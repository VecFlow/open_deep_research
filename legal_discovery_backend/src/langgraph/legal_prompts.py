Your goal is to generate {number_of_queries} document search queries that will help gather information for planning the legal analysis categories. 

The queries should:

1. Target key legal issues relevant to the case
2. Search for evidence related to liability, damages, and key parties
3. Identify potential witnesses and their involvement
4. Look for timeline information and critical events
5. Find documentation that supports or contradicts claims

Make the queries specific enough to find relevant documents, emails, contracts, and other evidence while covering the breadth needed for comprehensive case analysis.

Focus on:
- Names of parties involved
- Specific dates and time periods
- Key terms from contracts or agreements
- Technical terms relevant to the case
- Communication patterns between parties

<Task>
Generate a list of analysis categories for the case. Your plan should be comprehensive and strategic, focusing on building a strong litigation position.

Each category should have the fields:

- Name - Name for this category of legal analysis
- Description - Detailed overview of the legal issues and analysis objectives for this category
- Requires_document_search - Whether to perform document search for this category. IMPORTANT: Core factual categories (liability, damages, timeline, witnesses) MUST have requires_document_search=True. At least 3-4 categories should require document search.
- Content - The analysis content, which you will leave blank for now

Key categories to consider:
1. Liability Analysis - Establishing breach of duty, causation, and damages
2. Damages Assessment - Quantifying economic and non-economic damages
3. Key Witnesses - Identifying and analyzing witness testimony potential
4. Timeline of Events - Chronological analysis of critical events
5. Document Evidence - Analysis of contracts, emails, and other documents
6. Legal Precedents - Relevant case law (usually requires_document_search=False)
7. Deposition Strategy - Overall approach to depositions (usually requires_document_search=False)
8. Settlement Considerations - Strategic analysis (usually requires_document_search=False)

Ensure each category:
- Has a clear litigation purpose
- Will contribute to building the case
- Is distinct without overlap
- Directly supports case strategy

Generate strategic deposition questions for key witnesses identified in the case analysis.

For each witness, create questions that:
1. Establish foundational facts
2. Explore contradictions in documents/testimony
3. Lock in favorable admissions
4. Probe areas of vulnerability
5. Set up impeachment opportunities
6. Build evidence for summary judgment
7. Explore damages and causation

Question strategies:
- Start with open-ended questions to let witness talk
- Use specific documents to refresh recollection
- Ask about communications with other parties
- Explore timeline inconsistencies
- Get admissions on key legal elements
- Use "isn't it true that..." for critical facts
- Save confrontational questions for the end

Focus areas based on witness role:
- Corporate representatives: Authority, policies, decisions
- Technical witnesses: Standards, procedures, failures
- Financial witnesses: Damages, losses, calculations
- Fact witnesses: What they saw, heard, did
- Expert witnesses: Opinions, methodology, assumptions

Structure each question to:
- Have a clear strategic purpose
- Build toward case themes
- Anticipate likely responses
